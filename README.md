# lap-keys
A keyboard design that allows hands to naturally rest on the lap, while using

## Overview
This is a very early design concept for a new keyboard that will hopefully fix some ergonomic issues with my desk at home. Namely, I'm sick of keeping my hands up on a desk all day. I'd much rather let them relax on my lap while I work. Nothing I can find for commercially available (or other build-yourown) keyboard/mouse units seem to fit the bill.

## Progress

- I've ordered a number of parts for prototyping but they've yet to arrive so I'm doing what pre-work I can.
- Made an initial rough mockup of the CherryMX switches, as they are a common design. I can use this mock-up to build the sockets and spacing of the keyboard frame:
